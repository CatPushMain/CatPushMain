# Meowdy! I'm CatPushMain 😺👋

> **Professional Cat Developer** • **Expert in Napping** • **Pushing Main Directly Since 2021** 🚀

I'm the kind of developer who believes production is the best testing environment! Why waste time with branches when you can push straight to main? 😼

## 🎯 My Development Process

1. Find code on Stack Overflow
2. Copy it
3. Paste it
4. Push to main
5. Hope it works
6. If it breaks, repeat steps 1-5
